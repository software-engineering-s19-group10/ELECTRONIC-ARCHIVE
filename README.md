# ELECTRONIC-ARCHIVE
An electronic archive containing everything that is necessary to evaluate and run our software.

## Required Contents
> Taken from the official [course website](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~marsic/Teaching/SE/eArchive.html)

1. "README.txt" file containing all file names and for each file a brief description about the content of the file. 
Your "README.txt" must explain exactly how to run your software:
exact process of how to compile your source code and build a runnable file where to find the runnable file if you already supplied one
how exactly to run the runnableâ€”what are the allowed input parameters
if it is necessary to authenticate the user, then list some example user IDs and passwords that will work
describe the allowed values of all parameters that need to be entered while running your program
2. PDF files containing the entire Report #1 and Report #2 as these were originally sumbitted, not as modified as part of Report #3.
3. Microsoft PowerPoint files containing slides you used for your first demo and those used for the final demo.
4. PDF file containing the entire Report #3 as in the printed version submitted earlier. The report should appear as a single file.
5. Complete project source code (Java files, or other programming or markup language, if such is used)
6. Images or button icons loaded by the program when run
7. Shell-scripts, CGI scripts, HTML files, and any and all other files needed to run the program
8. Database tables and files or plain files containing example data to run the program
9. Anything else that your program requires to be run?
(Do not include publicly available or commercial software such as Java JDK packages or database software. We should not need special commercial software to run your software. )
10. Unit tests (program code to run unit tests and a README.txt on how to run the unit tests)
11. Integration tests (program code to run unit tests and a README.txt on how to run the integration tests)

## Repositories, File Names, & Descriptions

Below is a table of repositories (source code) or file names with a brief description of what they contain.

Name                        | Description
:-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------
Backend                     | Back-end database and REST API for the Smart Lock application. Also contains SMS and Stranger Reporting Network. View GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/software-engineering-s19-group10/smart-lock-backend).
Frontend                    | Frontend web application. See [How To Run](https://github.com/software-engineering-s19-group10/ELECTRONIC-ARCHIVE#how-to-run) for details on accessing it. View GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/software-engineering-s19-group10/frontend-demo).
Local Camera Processing     | Facial recognition processing and camera communication to be run on the Raspberry Pi. View GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/software-engineering-s19-group10/LocalCameraProcessing).
Streaming                   | Program for streaming video feed from Raspberry Pi to be displayed on web app. View GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/software-engineering-s19-group10/streaming).
Powerpoint Slides           | Powerpoint slides used during Demos #1 & #2. (Flattened/removed animations for reduced file size)
Report 1                    | Report #1 as submitted on: February 24th, 2019
Report 2                    | Report #2 as submitted on: March 17th, 2019
Report 3                    | Report #3 as submitted on: May 5th, 2019

## How To Run

1. Visit the [Smart Lock Website](https://smart-lock-demo.netlify.com/).
2. Enter credentials:
    > Username: smart-lock-admin

    > Password: softwareengineering
3. Web app should be intuative and work from there.
   
- NOTE: Some features will be non-functional unless our hardware (Raspberry Pi) is on and there is data to display.
